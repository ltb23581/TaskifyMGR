___________________________________________________________________________________________________

Introducing Taskify Manager, our first draft of a task management application! Developed using React by a team of four, TaskifyMGR aims to streamline project and task organization within groups.

TaskifyMGR enables users to efficiently allocate tasks and roles among team members. Within the user dashboard, team members can create projects, assign tasks, set due dates, and designate task-specific members. The application is powered by MongoDB for server operations and data storage.

Upcoming enhancements:

- Implement a settings page for users to manage their profiles (name, email, contact info, and profile picture).
- Introduce a progress bar for project folders to visualize task completion.
- Integrate a reminder feature to alert users of approaching deadlines.
- Enhance the calendar sidebar to display upcoming tasks.
- Update task and activity logs to reflect task completion and team member contributions.
